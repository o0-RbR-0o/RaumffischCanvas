Raumffisch\[Canvas\] (Dartsnake-mod)
==============

Raumffisch\[Canvas\] is the Canvas Version of a fork of Dartsnake by Nane Kratzke which implements a new game concept (Space(Fish) Shooter) while using the basic game grid and the MVC design of Dartsnake.
The Raumffisch project itself was a semester project for the class "Webtechnologien" at the University of Applied Sciences LÃ¼beck.
